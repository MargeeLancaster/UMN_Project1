## About Our Data

![zillowLogo](./images/zillowLogo.png)

> For our project, we sourced our data from Zillow.com one of the nations largest third party Real Estate sites. We chose Zillow  for this reason and that it is one of the only Real Estate firms that offer and maintain a free API on listings. Real Estate does not (yet) have a central API to allow prospective analysts access to Real Estate information. Alot of provided APIs require the company to be a registered MLS company which requires a fee as well as a fee to access the API. Zillow offers a free API through Quandl as well as a more indepth and free API through a company called Bridge.
